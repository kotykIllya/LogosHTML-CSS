    Laiho started playing violin at the age of seven and guitar at the age of
    11. His main influence when he started playing guitar was Helloween, then
    he got interested in more extreme music (mainly black metal) and by 1999
    he once again considered his main interests laid in classic metal bands
    like Manowar, Helloween, Judas Priest and W.A.S.P.<sup>[3]</sup> His first
    guitar was a "Tokai Stratocaster".<sup>[4]</sup>
</p>
<p>
    In 1993, after taking part in an experimental band named T.O.L.K. with
    friends he met while attending the Finnish Pop & Jazz Conservatory,<sup
>[5]</sup
>
    Laiho formed Children of Bodom together with drummer Jaska Raatikainen,
    under the name of IneartheD.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>
</p>
<p>
    On 31 October 1997, prior to releasing their debut album, Children of
    Bodom played their first concert in Helsinki, as opening act for Norway's
    Dimmu Borgir.
</p>
<p>
    Silenoz, Dimmu Borgir guitarist, on Laiho's first performance: “We could
    hear the opening band playing from backstage. We were like, ‘Holy shit,
    what is this?’ It sounded like Yngwie Malmsteen on speed. We ran out and
    watched the spectacle and stood there with our jaws open”. “There was this
    fucking beast on the guitar,” adds Dimmu's then-keyboardist Kimberly Goss,
    who would go on to form power metal band Sinergy with Alexi in 1997, and
    marry him in 2002. “I was looking at our guitar player like, ‘I don’t
    know, man, you’ve got some competition…”<sup>[8]</sup>
</p>

<p>
    Laiho recorded three full-length albums with Sinergy. An unreleased fourth
    album was recorded and slated to be released in 2005,<sup>[9]</sup> but
    the finishing touches were never completed due to Laiho's demanding
    schedule with Children of Bodom.
</p>
<p>
    In 2004, Laiho founded a side-project called Kylähullut, which was
    assembled together with drummer Tonmi Lillman (ex-Sinergy) and singer Vesa
    Jokinen 69er of Finnish punk band Klamydia. The band was created merely
    for the entertainment of the musicians, and takes a carefree approach to
    their music. Their discography includes two EP's, and two full-length
    albums one of which features Laiho's wife, Goss making her debut singing
    in the Finnish language on the band's self titled song.<sup>[10]</sup>
</p>
<p>
    Children of Bodom played at the 2008 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards.
    There, Laiho also received the Dimebag Award for "Best Shredder" and
    performed a track off of Bodom's 2008's album, Blooddrunk.
</p>
<p>
    Laiho appears on Canadian thrash metal outfit Annihilator's 2007 album,
    Metal, as a guest, performing a guitar solo on the song "Downright
    Dominate".
</p>
<p>
    On 3 July 2012, Children of Bodom announced on their Facebook page that
    they had to cancel two European shows because Laiho had been taken to the
    hospital because of severe stomach pain.<sup>[11]</sup> The frontman was
    hospitalized once again the following year in Nashville,<sup>[12]</sup>
    leading to speculation about his dangerous relationship with alcohol,
    which he'd later discuss in multiple interviews.<sup>[13]</sup
><sup>[14]</sup>
</p>
<p>
    On 15 December 2019, Children of Bodom played their last show at the
    Icehall in Helsinki, dubbed "A Chapter Called Children of Bodom"; in
    November it was announced that after this show, the group would disband
    after over two decades together.<sup>[15]</sup> Due to legal reasons,
    Laiho would no longer be able to continue using the Children of Bodom
    name.<sup>[16]</sup>
</p>
<p>
    In March 2020, Laiho would officially announce his new band together with
    former Children of Bodom guitarist Daniel Freyberg, Bodom After Midnight
    featuring drummer Waltteri Väyrynen and bassist Mitja Toivonen.
</p>
<p>
    Laiho died on 29 December 2020 due to liver degeneration resulting from
    years of alcohol abuse,<sup>[17]</sup> leaving behind a few songs recorded
    with Bodom After Midnight to be published posthumously.<sup
>[18][19][20]</sup

    Several months later, Daniel Freyberg told Loudwire that Bodom After
    Midnight would disband rather than replacing Laiho.<sup>[21]</sup>
</p>

<h2>Awards, recognition and legacy</h2>
<hr />
<p>
    Laiho has often been described as a visionary who brought back melody and
    flamboyance to metal music in a post-grunge and nu metal era. His guitar
    style was influenced by black metal, power metal and classical music, all
    cemented together by blistering solos. He was known for his
    guitar-keyboard solo duels with Janne Wirman, keyboardist in his band
    Children of Bodom.
</p>

    Laiho received a Metal Hammer Golden Gods prize in the category of Dimebag
    Darrell Shredder Award in 2008.<sup>[22]</sup>

    Laiho received widespread acclaim for his guitar work and according to
    AllMusic, he is "widely celebrated as one of the genre's most accomplished
    players".<sup>[23]</sup> In 2004 he was ranked No. 96 out of 100 Greatest
    Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time by Guitar World.<sup>[24]</sup> Guitar
    World magazine has also ranked him as one of the 50 fastest guitarists in
    the world.<sup>[25]</sup> In addition, Roadrunner Records ranked Laiho at
    No. 41 out of 50 of the greatest metal frontmen.<sup>[26]</sup>
    Furthermore, Total Guitar conducted a public voting poll to determine the

    metal guitarists, with over 20% of the vote.<sup>[27]</sup>
